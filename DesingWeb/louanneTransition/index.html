                <p>Since my younger age, i've always felt different. At first i thought
                    it was because i was almost the only asian in the middle of white people. I
                    didnt gave more thought than that really, i mean, what else could i do?
                    2 years ago (so in 2017) i felt like i would be way happier as a girl than a boy
                    but didnt made any research for it since i didnt really knew it was possible.
                    <br><br>
                    1 year ago i realised that it was possible and that the outcome was outstanding.
                    I began to look up there and there but i didnt really made my mind yet.
                    <br><br>
                    A couple of month ago (around may 2019) i decided to finally begin my transition.
                    So i asked began to see a psychologist so he can write a letter to my doctor (here in
                    Canada we need that) and be able to begin HRT (hormones). The psychologist was great,
                    he's from Montr√©al and he wrote the letter and then i went to see my family doctor.
                    <br><br>
                    He supported me in my adventure and asked me to see an endocrinologist for the dosage
                    of my hormones. I called to book an appointment with a public endocrinologist since
                    its free and that im poor. The receptionist told me the fastest appointment i could get to see a public endocrinologist
                    in 1 year!
                    <br><br>
                    I was kinda devastated to hear that and asked her if i could see a private one.
                    She said yes but she doubt i will find one. Turns out i did found one, pretty quickly actually.
                    Then i saw the endocrinologist (cost me 300$ rip) and he prescribed me 1mg Estrace and 50mg Androcur
                    daily.</p><br><br>
